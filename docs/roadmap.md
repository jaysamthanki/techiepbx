# Roadmap

Built piece by piece. Each piece should build, pass tests and be verified on the lab VM
before the next one starts. **What** we build is defined in [features.md](features.md);
this file is the **order**.

| # | Piece | Feature | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Architecture decisions | | Done (see decisions.md) |
| 1 | Spike: Asterisk LTS built from source on a Debian VM, hand-written config, echo test | | Done 2026-09-13 |
| 2 | Solution layout, log4net, cookie auth | | Done 2026-09-13 |
| 3 | Extensions: model, schema, repository, pjsip/extensions renderers, atomic writer, tests | F2 | Done 2026-09-13 |
| 4 | AMI client + "apply config" (DB → render → write → reload only what changed) | | Done 2026-09-15 |
| 5 | Extensions UI: table + modals, live registration status | F2 | **Next** |
| 6 | Auth hardening: app role requirement (break-glass deferred) | | |
| 7 | Generate the remaining base config: `modules.conf` allowlist, `logger.conf`, `rtp.conf`, `manager.conf`, `asterisk.conf` | | |
| 8 | Destinations: shared "send call to X" model + dialplan helper | supporting | |
| 9 | Generic SIP trunk | F1 | |
| 10 | Outbound routes (international restricted by default) | supporting | |
| 11 | Inbound routes (DID → destination) | supporting | |
| 12 | Callcentric wizard (verify settings on lab VM first) | F1 | |
| 13 | Voicemail | F2a | |
| 14 | Email notifications (voicemail to email first, then alerts) | F4 | |
| 15 | Ring groups: ring all + hunt | F3 | |
| 16 | Follow me | F2b | |
| 17 | IVRs (with audio file handling) | F6 | |
| 18 | Call reports | F5 | |
| 19 | Helper: Unix socket, peer credential check, first commands (firewall) | | |
| 20 | fail2ban setup, then own AMI-security-event blocker via Helper | | |
| 21 | Installer script for fresh Debian (users, permissions, hardened systemd units, polkit rule, Asterisk build) | | |

The order after piece 7 is a proposal. The reasoning: trunks and routes first so the system can
make and take real calls; voicemail before email because voicemail-to-email is the first email
use; ring groups, follow me and IVR all send calls to destinations, so destinations come early;
reports last because they only need call data to exist. Helper, fail2ban and installer can move
earlier whenever deployment needs them. Record changes here.

## Piece 4 detail (done 2026-09-15)

- `Techie.Pbx.Asterisk/Ami/`: minimal AMI client over TCP. `Login`, `Logoff`, action/response
  with ActionID matching, event lists, event reading, `Reload` and `PJSIPShowContacts`.
  `Action: Command` was dropped (D17), so the AMI user needs no `command` permission.
- `ConfigApplier`: renders every file from the database, writes with `WriteAtomic`, then reloads
  only the modules whose files changed (D16). `ConfigApplier.FromDatabase` is the normal wiring.
- Settings: `Settings` key/value table, script `002_settings.sql`, keys in `SettingsKeys`,
  read through `SettingsRepository` and turned into objects by `AsteriskSettings`. The AMI
  secret lives there too (D14, D15).
- Tests: AMI protocol and session against canned responses, settings repository and loader,
  applier from database to files. The end-to-end reload check happens on the lab VM.

Left for later, on purpose: nothing writes the settings yet (no UI, and `manager.conf` with the
AMI user is generated in piece 7), so a lab VM has to have its AMI rows inserted by hand or by
the lab script until then.

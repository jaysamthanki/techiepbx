# Roadmap

Built piece by piece. Each piece should build, pass tests and be verified on the lab VM
before the next one starts. **What** we build is defined in [features.md](features.md);
this file is the **order**.

| # | Piece | Feature | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Architecture decisions | | Done (see decisions.md) |
| 1 | Spike: Asterisk LTS built from source on a Debian VM, hand-written config, echo test | | Done 2026-09-13 |
| 2 | Solution layout, log4net, cookie auth | | Done 2026-09-13 |
| 3 | Extensions: model, schema, repository, pjsip/extensions renderers, atomic writer, tests | F2 | Done 2026-09-13 |
| 4 | AMI client + "apply config" (DB → render → write → reload only what changed) | | Done 2026-09-15 |
| 5 | Extensions UI: table + modals, live registration status, local auth bypass (D24), Data folder (D25), config-pending marker (D26) | F2 | Code done 2026-09-15, lab run in progress |
| 6 | Auth hardening: app role requirement (break-glass deferred) | | |
| 7 | Generate the remaining base config: `modules.conf` allowlist, `logger.conf`, `rtp.conf`, `manager.conf`, `asterisk.conf` | | |
| 8 | Destinations: shared "send call to X" model + dialplan helper | supporting | |
| 9 | Generic SIP trunk | F1 | |
| 10 | Outbound routes (international restricted by default) | supporting | |
| 11 | Inbound routes (DID → destination) | supporting | |
| 12 | Callcentric wizard (verify settings on lab VM first) | F1 | |
| 13 | Voicemail | F2a | |
| 14 | Email notifications (voicemail to email first, then alerts) | F4 | |
| 15 | Ring groups: ring all + hunt | F3 | |
| 16 | Follow me | F2b | |
| 17 | IVRs (with audio file handling) | F6 | |
| 18 | Call reports | F5 | |
| 19 | Helper: Unix socket, peer credential check, first commands (firewall) | | |
| 20 | fail2ban setup, then own AMI-security-event blocker via Helper | | |
| 21 | Installer script for fresh Debian (users, permissions, hardened systemd units, polkit rule, Asterisk build) | | |

The order after piece 7 is a proposal. The reasoning: trunks and routes first so the system can
make and take real calls; voicemail before email because voicemail-to-email is the first email
use; ring groups, follow me and IVR all send calls to destinations, so destinations come early;
reports last because they only need call data to exist. Helper, fail2ban and installer can move
earlier whenever deployment needs them. Record changes here.

## Piece 4 detail (done 2026-09-15)

- `Techie.Pbx.Asterisk/Ami/`: minimal AMI client over TCP. `Login`, `Logoff`, action/response
  with ActionID matching, event lists, event reading, `Reload` and `PJSIPShowContacts`.
  `Action: Command` was dropped (D17), so the AMI user needs no `command` permission.
- `ConfigApplier`: renders every file from the database, writes with `WriteAtomic`, then reloads
  only the modules whose files changed (D16). `ConfigApplier.FromDatabase` is the normal wiring.
- Settings: `Settings` key/value table, script `002_settings.sql`, keys in `SettingsKeys`,
  read through `SettingsRepository` and turned into objects by `AsteriskSettings`. The AMI
  secret lives there too (D14, D15).
- Tests: AMI protocol and session against canned responses, settings repository and loader,
  applier from database to files. The end-to-end reload check happens on the lab VM.

Left for later, on purpose: nothing writes the settings yet (no UI, and `manager.conf` with the
AMI user is generated in piece 7), so a lab VM has to have its AMI rows inserted by hand or by
the lab script until then.

## Piece 5 detail (code done 2026-09-15)

- `/Extensions`: bootstrap-table of number, name, enabled and a live registration badge, with
  create, edit and delete in sweetalert2 modals, "show password", "regenerate password" and
  "apply config". The page is a shell; htmx fetches every part of it from page handlers as HTML
  partials, and changes answer 204 with `HX-Trigger` events (D21).
- `RegistrationStatus` (in `Techie.Pbx.Asterisk/Ami`) turns `PJSIPShowContacts` into a state per
  extension number and never throws: no AMI means every badge says Unknown. The page polls it
  once every 5 seconds and htmx swaps the badges out of band.
- `PbxDatabase` opens the database at startup from `Database:Path` (D22); pages and controllers
  build their own repositories over it.
- API: `POST /api/config/apply`, `GET`/`POST /api/extensions/{id}/secret`. Unauthenticated calls
  now get 401 rather than a redirect (D20), and every browser call carries an antiforgery header
  (D23).

Still to do before this piece is finished:

- **Nobody has signed in to this app yet.** The Entra app registration needs a redirect URI for
  wherever the lab VM serves the UI, and `AzureAd:ClientSecret` or a certificate in user secrets
  or the environment for the code flow. No bypass was added; see the open question below.
- Run it on the lab VM: sign in, create an extension, apply, register a phone against it and
  watch the badge turn green. Nothing in the UI has touched a real Asterisk yet.
- Per-extension caller ID for outbound calls (listed under F2) is not built; it waits for trunks
  and outbound routes to exist.
- The "apply config" reminder is only in the browser that made the change: reload the page, or
  open a second one, and it is gone while the config is still unapplied. Doing it properly means
  asking the applier whether the rendered files differ from the ones on disk. Ask before
  building it.
